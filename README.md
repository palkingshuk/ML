## ‚ú® About The Project

This repository aims to provide clear and concise implementations of common machine learning algorithms, often from scratch or with minimal reliance on high-level libraries for the core logic. This approach helps in building a deeper understanding of how these algorithms work under the hood.

The notebooks cover:
*   Theoretical explanations of the algorithms.
*   Step-by-step Python implementations.
*   Application to sample datasets.
*   Visualization of results and model behavior.

## üß† Algorithms & Concepts Covered

Here's a list of the Jupyter Notebooks available and the topics they cover:

### Regression
*   `Linear_Regression.ipynb`: Implementation of simple Linear Regression.
*   `Multiple_Regression.ipynb`: Implementation of Multiple Linear Regression (with multiple features).
*   `polynomial-regression (1).ipynb`: Demonstrates Polynomial Regression for non-linear data.
*   `ridge-regression-from-scratch-m-and-b.ipynb`: Ridge Regression implemented from scratch, focusing on calculating coefficients.
*   `ridge_regression_from_scratch_rn_and_b.ipynb`: (Likely another variant or step in Ridge Regression from scratch, possibly a typo for 'm' or a different formulation).
*   `ridge-regression-gradient-descent.ipynb`: Ridge Regression implemented using the Gradient Descent optimization algorithm.

### Classification
*   `Logisitic-Regression-gradient-descent.ipynb` (sic, likely "Logistic"): Logistic Regression for binary classification implemented with Gradient Descent.
*   `Logisitc_regression_Perceptron_Trick.ipynb` (sic, likely "Logistic"): Logistic Regression, possibly exploring the Perceptron update rule or a similar trick.
*   `softmax-demo.ipynb`: Demonstration of the Softmax function, often used as the activation in the output layer of a multi-class classification neural network.

### Optimization
*   `gradient_descent_step_by_step.ipynb`: A detailed, step-by-step explanation and implementation of the Gradient Descent algorithm.
*   `Batch_GRD.ipynb`: Implementation of Batch Gradient Descent.
*   `Mini_Batch_Gradient_Descent.ipynb`: Implementation of Mini-Batch Gradient Descent.

### Evaluation Metrics
*   `classification-metrics-binary.ipynb`: Explores and implements various metrics for evaluating binary classification models (e.g., Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix).
*   `classification-metrics-multi-mnist1.ipynb`: Explores and implements metrics for multi-class classification, potentially using the MNIST dataset as an example.

## üìä Datasets Used

The following datasets are used in various notebooks:
*   `Student_Performance.csv`: Likely used for regression or classification tasks related to student academic performance.
*   `placement (1).csv`: Likely used for regression or classification tasks, possibly related to job placement predictions.
*   *MNIST dataset might be used internally in `classification-metrics-multi-mnist1.ipynb` (often downloaded via libraries like Scikit-learn or TensorFlow/Keras).*

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You'll also need Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
The common Python libraries required are:
*   `numpy`
*   `pandas`
*   `matplotlib`
*   `seaborn`
*   `scikit-learn` (even if implementing from scratch, often used for data splitting, metrics, or comparison)

You can install these using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyterlab
```
### Installation & Usage
* Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/palkingshuk/ML.git

* Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd ML
```
* Launch JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter lab or
jupyter notebook
  
* Open any of the .ipynb files from the Jupyter interface and run the cells.
